My Nes Version 7.13.8087.35622

-------------

- Improved Audio Downsampler. 
- Improved Audio generally.
- Improved performance by converting audio samples from integers into bytes.
- Audio now is output in unsigned 8 bit instead of signed 16 bit, it is correct for nes.
- Improved SlimDX DirectSound renderer, it sounds now better and stable.

### Notes:

- It may sound error sometimes with some games, but it is correct. Since nes sound output is about 179 MHz and
  Audio Channels might sound up to 444000 Hz, so downsampling from 444000 Hz into 44100 Hz will result a loss of resolution.
  Applying fixes like taking averages of samples proved to be wrong, so in My Nes, the downsampler now just do downsampling
  without any fix. This is correct but might sound error, this is normal due to the loss of resolution.
- Nes when outputing audio samples and mixed together, they are range from 0 into 1 in amplitude. If we try to convert
  that to 8 bit samples or signed 16 bits will result errors and corruption in sound. The correct convert is from 0-1 apm into 
  0-127 value or 0 - 0x7F. My Nes now output sound in 8bits with range of 0 - 127, applying a simple fix as well that makes sure
  no sample is 0 (DB Fix, see <https://github.com/jegqamas/Docs/blob/main/Audio%20And%20DB.txt>) to make the sound 100 % correct.
- Performance is improved by using 8 bit audio samples instead of 16 bit samples, also renderer now control speed correctly to
  make sure audio samples are played correctly in time. This affect performance and accuracy of fps.
